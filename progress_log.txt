Fist commit 20.2.:
  Starting main MyApplication


Second commit 1.3.: (and 7.3. addad progress_log)
  Changed the camera of MyApplication to perspective.
  Added classes 'Food' and 'Snake'.
  Having a couple of problems/errors in Object MyApplication and class 'Snake'.

  MyApplication: Lines 45-51 and lines 91-104 are giving me problems and warnings.
  Snake: Lines 40-44 and line 161 are giving me errors.

  I don't know how to fix these, and I am stuck. I hope you could help me and correct them.


  Third commit 15.3.
    Corrected the errors in snake class and MyApplication object.
    Added start of gameloop
    Not running the application due to some errors when run.



  Fourth commit 20.3.
    Updated AnimationTimer and tried to make camera good.
    Now the snake moves somehow and no errors.
    The biggest problem is with the grid and the camera. There's no way I can make it look decent. It looks so laggy.
    I can't really make progress with my work, as I have some good ideas to continue the project, but I just can't get the grid and camera right. I've tried myself, looked at the model project, YouTube and information on the internet, but it doesn't open up for me.
    I hope you could help.


  Fifth commit 28.3.
    Tryied again to work with the camera. Now it somewhat changes angle when the snake changes side of cube.
    Still my Biggest and hardest issue is the camera. I hope to get help.
    Having problems with the last bodypart of the snake. It isn't connected with the body.


  Sixth commit 8.4.
    A little bit of class structions so that it is easier to handle the code.
    Camera only moves between several fixed position now
    Updated game loop
    Did some changes to snake, now it moves fully
    XXX -> The camera angles are still problem. I don't know if the snake eats the food or not? What could I do next??


  Seventh commit 25.4.
    Haven't have time to update code since too many courses. Got from Lauri Malmi extra time so my deadline is 2.5.
    Will continue this week the project.


  Eighth commit 28.4.
    Changed the camera back to fixed camera.
    Also now the snake eats the food BUT only when it it on the right side of the cube
    Because I don't know how to fix the camera, the player can't know what side the food is in.

    2.5.
    Fixed camera

    2.5.
    Finished the game. STill problems with camera and eating and growing...
