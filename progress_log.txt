Changed the camera of MyApplication to perspective.
Added classes 'Food' and 'Snake'.
Having a couple of problems/errors in Object MyApplication and class 'Snake'.

MyApplication: Lines 45-51 and lines 91-104 are giving me problems and warnings.
Snake: Lines 40-44 and line 161 are giving me errors.

I don't know how to fix these, and I am stuck. I hope you could help me and correct them.
